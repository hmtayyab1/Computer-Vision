🧠 ##Computer Vision Project
This project explores the impact of saliency map integration on the performance of an image retrieval system. Using a dataset of nearly 10,000 images, the workflow involves:

✅ Fine-tuning an Object Detection model

✅ Generating Saliency Maps to highlight visually important regions

✅ Implementing an Image Retrieval model, both with and without saliency-guided attention

✅ Comparing retrieval performance before and after incorporating saliency information

🔍 Objectives
Improve the relevance of retrieved images using saliency cues

Evaluate how visual attention affects similarity matching

Measure retrieval accuracy and visual quality pre- and post-saliency integration

🛠️ Techniques & Tools
Object Detection (e.g., YOLO / Faster R-CNN)

Saliency Map Generation (e.g., Grad-CAM / Deep Gaze / other)

Feature extraction with CNNs / Vision Transformers

Similarity Matching (e.g., cosine distance)

Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.

📊 Results
Demonstrated that incorporating saliency maps improves retrieval accuracy

Visual and quantitative comparisons included
