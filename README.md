# 🧠 Computer Vision Project

This project explores the impact of saliency map integration on the performance of an image retrieval system. Using a dataset of nearly 10,000 images, the workflow involves:

✅ Fine-tuning an Object Detection model

✅ Generating Saliency Maps to highlight visually important regions

✅ Implementing an Image Retrieval model, both with and without saliency-guided attention

✅ Comparing retrieval performance before and after incorporating saliency information

# 🔍 Objectives

Improve the relevance of retrieved images using saliency cues

Evaluate how visual attention affects similarity matching

Measure retrieval accuracy and visual quality pre- and post-saliency integration

# 🛠️ Techniques & Tools

Object Detection (YOLO)

Saliency Map Generation (Grad-CAM/RESNET18)

Saliency Ma Image Retrieval (VGG16)

Similarity Matching (cosine distance)

Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Pandas, Numpy.

📊 Results

Demonstrated that incorporating saliency maps improves retrieval accuracy

Visual and quantitative comparisons included
